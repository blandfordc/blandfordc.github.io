1. **What Software Engineering is to Me (1/16/2017)** 
With no personal influence, software engineering is to come up with, test, and use new code that is needed for certain projects in whatever field of interest they have. I know that they have to work with a team, often. They seem to set the base for the project, and work with the developers to see it come to fruition, and work through any potential bugs or other things they may have to fix. More personally, software engineering for me is a potential career. I came into Xavier with absolutely no experience in computer science last year, but wanted to test it out and see how it may go. I really enjoyed the first class, and so took another, and eventually also declared the major. Sometimes, I feel very behind compared to other people in the classes, who seem to have accomplished so much already, but I caught up quick, and am staying on pace and enjoying it.
